# üß† TumorAI: Brain Tumor Segmentation & Reporting System

TumorAI is a streamlined, showcase-ready diagnostic tool that performs tumor segmentation on brain MRI slices using deep learning. It visualizes tumor structures, generates clinical-style reports, and sends automatic alerts to professional channels such as Slack. This project was designed and implemented for the Vanderbilt AI Showcase with emphasis on innovation, automation, and medical impact.

## üéØ Niche Problem

Brain tumors are time-sensitive conditions that often require radiologists and neurosurgeons to manually inspect MRI scans, segment abnormal regions, and document observations. This process can:

- Be **labor-intensive** and prone to human error
- Delay **treatment planning** in resource-limited settings
- Require specialist interpretation, which may not be locally available

TumorAI addresses these challenges by providing an **AI-first assistant** that automatically:

- Segments key tumor regions (Edema, Enhancing Tumor, Necrotic Core)
- Overlays color-coded results for clarity
- Calculates confidence scores
- Outputs a **professionally styled PDF report**
- Sends alert messages to clinical channels (e.g. Slack)
- Uses **Google Gemini** to generate both a brief summary and a full clinical write-up

## üß† Model Training

The segmentation model was based on a pre-trained U-Net-style architecture optimized for brain tumor segmentation using the [BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) 2020 dataset](https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2020/data.html). Key features:

- **Input:** T1-weighted or T2-weighted axial brain MRI slice
- **Output:** Multiclass pixel mask with 3 classes
- **Architecture:** U-Net with batch normalization and dropout regularization
- **Training source:** Adapted from publicly available TensorFlow-based models, specifically [this repo](https://github.com/abhi-kumar/Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-Unet)
- **Labels:** 
  - 1: Edema (yellow)
  - 2: Enhancing Tumor (red)
  - 3: Necrotic Core (blue)

## üñ•Ô∏è Features

### ‚úÖ Upload & Analyze
- Upload any MRI slice (JPG/PNG)
- See segmentation overlaid on the original scan
- Confidence level shown in the UI

### ‚úÖ Report Generation
- Add optional clinical guideline notes
- Gemini automatically creates:
  - A brief **Model Summary** (short impression)
  - A **Full Clinical Report** (detailed factual write-up)
- PDF includes original image, overlay, summary, notes, and full write-up
- Download directly from the app

### ‚úÖ Slack Automation

## ü§ñ Automation & Workflow Potential

TumorAI is not just a demo ‚Äî it lays the foundation for real-world clinical workflows such as:

- **Automatic triaging**: Prioritize patients with likely tumors
- **Remote diagnostics**: Send reports to doctors via Slack, email, or EHR systems
- **Data audit pipelines**: Track scans and reports for documentation

Future integrations may include:
- Uploading to **Google Drive** or **FHIR-based hospital systems**
- Real-time analysis of DICOM datasets
- Integration with platforms like **Hugging Face Spaces** or **Render**

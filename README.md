# 🧠 TumorAI: Brain Tumor Segmentation & Reporting System

TumorAI is a streamlined diagnostic tool that performs tumor segmentation on brain MRI slices using deep learning. It visualizes tumor structures, generates clinical-style reports, and sends automatic alerts to professional channels such as Slack. This project was designed and implemented with emphasis on innovation, automation, and medical impact.

## 🎯 Niche Problem

Brain tumors are time-sensitive conditions that often require radiologists and neurosurgeons to manually inspect MRI scans, segment abnormal regions, and document observations. This process can:

- Be **labor-intensive** and prone to human error
- Delay **treatment planning** in resource-limited settings
- Require specialist interpretation, which may not be locally available

TumorAI addresses these challenges by providing an **AI-first assistant** that automatically:

- Segments key tumor regions (Edema, Enhancing Tumor, Necrotic Core)
- Overlays color-coded results for clarity
- Calculates confidence scores
- Outputs a **professionally styled PDF report**
- Sends alert messages to clinical channels (e.g. Slack)
- Uses **Google Gemini** to generate both a brief summary and a full clinical write-up

## 🧠 Model Training & Technology Stack

TumorAI's segmentation model is built on a U-Net architecture, a convolutional neural network designed for biomedical image segmentation. Here's how it works:

### 🔍 U-Net Overview:
- **Encoder**: captures spatial features using convolution + pooling
- **Bottleneck**: compresses representation (abstract tumor signal)
- **Decoder**: reconstructs segmentation masks with upsampling + skip connections

### ⚙️ Technical Details:
- Framework: TensorFlow (Keras API)
- Image size: 128×128 grayscale slices (4-channel stacked)
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss: Categorical cross-entropy
- Postprocessing: Argmax and confidence map extraction

### 📊 Training Dataset:
- [BraTS 2020](https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2020/data.html)
- Multimodal MRI scans (T1, T2, FLAIR)
- Ground truth segmentations for 3 tumor types:
  - Edema (1)
  - Enhancing Tumor (2)
  - Necrotic Core (3)

> The U-Net model is effective for medical image segmentation due to its ability to preserve fine-grained localization using skip connections.

## 🤖 Automation & Workflow Potential

TumorAI is not just a demo — it lays the foundation for real-world clinical workflows such as:

- **Automatic triaging**: Prioritize patients with likely tumors
- **Remote diagnostics**: Send reports to doctors via Slack, email, or EHR systems
- **Data audit pipelines**: Track scans and reports for documentation

Future integrations may include:
- Uploading to **Google Drive** or **FHIR-based hospital systems**
- Real-time analysis of DICOM datasets
- Integration with platforms like **Hugging Face Spaces** or **Render**
